## Problem

In agentic AI scenarios, LLM responses may contain malicious URLs, IP addresses, or other harmful content that downstream agents could blindly act upon. KAITO needs a mechanism to filter/block such content before it reaches the caller.

## Candidate Solutions

| Solution | Project | Type |
|----------|---------|------|
| **LLM Guard** | [protectai/llm-guard](https://github.com/protectai/llm-guard) | Python library with pluggable output scanners |
| **Llama Firewall** | [meta-llama/PurpleLlama](https://github.com/meta-llama/PurpleLlama/tree/main/LlamaFirewall) | Meta's safety framework, uses PromptGuard model |
| **NeMo Guardrails** | [NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Guardrails) | NVIDIA's dialog-level guardrails with Colang DSL |
| **MCP Context Protector** | [trailofbits/mcp-context-protector](https://github.com/trailofbits/mcp-context-protector) | MCP protocol-specific protection |
| **Custom pattern matching** | Self-built | Simple regex-based URL/IP/keyword blocking |

## Recommendation: LLM Guard

LLM Guard is the best fit for KAITO. Here's why:

### 1. Architecture Alignment

KAITO's inference runtime is Python-based (vLLM's `inference_api.py`). LLM Guard is a Python library that can be embedded directly as middleware in the vLLM response pipeline — no extra sidecar containers or external services required.

### 2. Rich Out-of-the-Box Scanners

LLM Guard provides ready-to-use [output scanners](https://protectai.github.io/llm-guard/output_scanners/) that directly address the issue requirements:

- **`MaliciousURLs`** — Detects and blocks malicious URLs (the core ask in the issue)
- **`Regex`** — Custom pattern matching for IPs, keywords, etc.
- **`BanTopics`** — Topic-based content blocking
- **`Sensitive`** — PII/sensitive data detection
- **`Toxicity`**, **`Bias`** — Additional safety layers

No need to build and maintain custom regex patterns that inevitably miss edge cases (encoded URLs, URL shorteners, unicode tricks, etc.).

### 3. Lightweight — No Extra GPU Required

Most LLM Guard scanners use rule-based/pattern matching without requiring additional model inference. This is critical for KAITO where GPU resources are already dedicated to the served model.

### 4. Why Not the Others?

| Solution | Reason for Not Choosing |
|----------|------------------------|
| **NeMo Guardrails** | Heavyweight — requires defining Colang dialog flows; designed for conversational systems rather than API serving; introduces NVIDIA ecosystem dependency |
| **Llama Firewall** | Requires running PromptGuard safety model for classification — additional GPU/CPU overhead; complex deployment |
| **MCP Context Protector** | Designed specifically for the MCP protocol; does not align with KAITO's OpenAI-compatible API serving model |
| **Custom pattern matching** | Feasible for an MVP but high maintenance cost; prone to bypasses via URL encoding, short links, unicode variants; LLM Guard already handles these edge cases |

## Proposed Integration

### Data Flow

```
User Request → vLLM Inference → LLM Guard Output Scanners → Filtered Response
```

### Configuration via ConfigMap

Leverage KAITO's existing ConfigMap mechanism (`inference_config.yaml`) to allow users to configure guardrails declaratively:

```yaml
# inference_config.yaml
vllm:
  # existing vllm args...

guardrails:
  enabled: true
  output_scanners:
    - name: MaliciousURLs
      threshold: 0.5
    - name: Regex
      patterns:
        - "\\b\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\.\\d{1,3}\\b"  # block raw IPs
    - name: BanTopics
      topics: ["violence"]
```

This allows users to enable/disable scanners and customize rules through the ConfigMap without rebuilding the container image.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Add `llm-guard` as a dependency** in KAITO's vLLM inference image
2. **Create a guardrails middleware** in `inference_api.py` that intercepts vLLM responses
3. **Parse guardrails config** from `inference_config.yaml`
4. **Instantiate configured scanners** at startup
5. **Apply scanners** to each response before returning to the client
6. **Log/metric** blocked responses for observability

### Streaming Considerations

For streaming responses (`stream=true`), the scanner needs to operate on accumulated chunks or use a sliding window approach. LLM Guard supports scanning partial text, but latency tradeoffs should be documented.
